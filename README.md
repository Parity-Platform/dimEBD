VR Flow for training Electrical Installer Training on EV Charging Station Troubleshooting

---

## 📝 Overview  
This project is a **Virtual Reality training simulation** built in **Unity**.  
Its goal is to provide electricians with a safe, immersive environment to practice the **installation of Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers**.  

Currently, the simulation includes a step where the user connects a cable to a **tester box**, which validates whether the cable is **functional** or **faulty**.  

More training steps and features are planned for future development.

## ✨ Features  
- ✅ Immersive VR training environment.  
- ✅ Interactive task: connecting a cable to a **tester box**.  
- ✅ Realistic feedback on cable condition (working / faulty).
