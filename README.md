VR Flow for training Electrical Installer Training on EV Charging Station Troubleshooting

---

## üìù Overview  
This project is a **Virtual Reality training simulation** built in **Unity**.  
It's goal is to provide electricians with a safe, immersive environment to practice the **installation of Electric Vehicle (EV) chargers**.  

Currently, the simulation includes a step where the user connects a cable to a **tester box**, which validates whether the cable is **functional** or **faulty**.  

More training steps and features are planned for future development.

## ‚ú® Features  
- ‚úÖ Immersive VR training environment.  
- ‚úÖ Interactive task: connecting a cable to a **tester box**.  
- ‚úÖ Realistic feedback on cable condition (working / faulty).
